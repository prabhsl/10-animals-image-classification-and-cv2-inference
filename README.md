A convolutional neural network model trained on the 10 animals dataset.
This model is able to classify between 10 different animal categories
1) butterfly
2) cat
3) chicken
4) cow
5) dog
6) elephant
7) horse
8) sheep
9) spider
10) squirrel

the model currently has 65% validation accuracy
I have also made another jupyter notebook which uses the trained model and to visualize the results of the model and annotate them onto an image I have used opencv
